# AR_EDU

 
This application is created for the purpose of education. It includes physics experiments that can be played on your phone using AR. Creators of the app believe that applications like this could be used in schools to help children learn their subjects.


INSTALLATION:

To install this application on your android device, you'll need to copy this repository to your computer and open it  with UNITY game engine (best with version 2019.3.11f1). Then, after connecting your phone to the said computer and allowing debugging mode in your phone's developer options, fo the following: File > Build Settings > Build and run. 

If the application opens itself after building it, you're set. Otherwise, we recommend to instead of pressing "Build and Run" press the "Build" button and upload saved apk to your phone. Once you do so, manually locate it in your phone and install it just like any other app that is not from Play Store. 


USAGE: 

After the app is opened, there are two buttons: "Pradėti" and "Nustatymai". If you press on the second button, you'll be able to change volume. If you click the first button, a menu appears where it is possible to choose topic of which the experiments will be observed. Afterwards, there is another menu of sub-topics, so you can choose whichever experiment to play. Once you're done, you can use your usual 'back' button or motion of the phone and you'll be once again in the menu where sub-topics of your picked experiments are displayed.
